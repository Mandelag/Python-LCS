Python LCS

A relatively simple Python script to find the longest common subsequence(s) of two lists of integers. For more information on the problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem

To use: store two lists of comma-separated integers in "lists.txt", separated by a line break. A lists.txt file is checked into the repo, populated with randomly generated lists of 100 integers as an example.
